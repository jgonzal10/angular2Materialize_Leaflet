FAQ

### How about new feature?

Since this project has been reached its initial goal to provide a small and clean code base for Angular 2 and Leaflet integration, currently there is no plan for new feature development. However, I am open to suggestions and PRs. If you think it's beneficial for **general developers** to add something new, please feel free to submit an issue for dicussion.

How to develop
--------------

This project requires [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/docs/installation.html). Please install them first!

1.	Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

2.	Run `webpack` to build the project.

3.	As a more convinient way, use the [webpack-dev-server](http://webpack.github.io/docs/installation.html) to run the app at `http://localhost:8080`
